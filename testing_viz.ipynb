In other words, we should expect that regardless of what exact time along the curve we're looking at (and thus what the current case count for that day is), the daily increase in case counts from the previous day (roughly the derivative in the discrete case) should be at the same proportion. When we plot that out here, using `NewConfirmed` and `Confirmed` counts for various countries, we can see that countries who have plateaued start to fall off that line quite rapidly. This makes it an incredibly powerful and visual tool to see where we are in the long-term trajectory. \n",

This corresponds to our logistic curve. Note that when $Y$ is much smaller than $L$, the ratio of $Y/L$ goes to zero, and the rate of change looks a lot like the exponential.  -->"

    "Containment is a critical measure in reducing effective reproductive number of the virus. Most early-stage growth models can be viewed as a piecewise composition of a basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and a second effective reproduction number($R_e$). A team at the University of Toronto has a great article and corresponding dashboard explaining this concept: https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2760912/reporting-epidemic-growth-reproduction-numbers-2019-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov. \n",
    "\n",
    "US states have undergone containment measures along different timelines. Assuming a delay comprised of a biological incubation, delay for testing & recording, we can expect to see tangible changes to ($R_e$) roughly 1.5 - 2 weeks following an intervention. However, the gradual change in rate, as opposed to a piecewise shift we'd expect following the containment reflects the fact that lockdowns in the US have not been as stringent as in China, for example, and may only slow the growth, instead of dropping the rate down below 1."

    "(As per my knowledge) These tests are almost all RT-PCR tests, which test for viral nucleic acid (the instructions needed to replicate). An actively infected (or exposed) individual will have this in their body fluids, but those who have been exposed and successfully recovered (that is, they've developed antibodies to excise the virus from their system), will no longer have these strands of RNA and subsequently test negative. (That's where serological tests come in, but that's another issue).\n",
    "\n",
    "As availability of testing kits have been rather scarce, one way to better estimate the number of infected patients in a commmunity may be to look at the proportion of tests administered that come up positive. The higher the ratio, the greater one could \"weight\" the confirmed case counts from that day– if almost every test administered comes back positive, it means that there's probably a lot of folks who haven't gotten tested yet and defintely should.
